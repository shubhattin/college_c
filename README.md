## Linked List

1. Write a program that uses functions to perform the following
   - Create a singly linked list of integers
   - Insert a given integer in the above linked list at beginning, middle and end.
   - Delete a given integr in the above linked list at beginning, middle and end.
   - Display the contents of the list after deletion.
  [Here](./04/Link.c)
2. Write a program that uses functions to perform the following
   - Create a doubly linked list of integers
   - Insert a given integer in the above linked list at beginning, middle and end.
